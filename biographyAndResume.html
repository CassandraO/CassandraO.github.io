    <p>My name is Cassandra Oppedal and I'm 21 years old. I am a junior at Eastern Washington University. I am working towards a degree in Technical Communication as well as a minor in Visual Communication Design. I'm a hardworking and dedicated student who makes the Dean's List each quarter. I enjoy learning new things and meeting new people. In my spare time I enjoy writing Sci-Fi Fantasy novels and re-watching my favorite episodes of Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries.</p>
